# FAQs

### How can I find someone using the heatmap?

Use the map to check out people who are nearby.  Those closest will always pop up as you navigate the map.  Move towards the hotspots to find and meet more people.  You can also zoom out by tapping the map circle in the upper right hand corner to see who is around you on a larger scale.

### Does the heatmap indicate my exact position in real time?

No, your exact location is never revealed nor does the heatmap reveal the exact locations of other users.  The heatmap only indicates your general vicinity and will not provide specific distances.

### How do I interact with other profiles?

You can wave “Hello” to someone that you’re interested in. You can hide any profile that you don’t like. The person won’t find out and you will no longer see them on the heatmap.

### How can I start a conversation with someone?

You can’t talk to another user immediately.  To start a conversation, you can wave “Hello” along with a brief message or the icebreaker game, “Two truths, 1 lie”.  Once you wave “Hello”, you can specify how long the other person has to respond to you.  If they respond within the given time frame, you can then start chatting.

So, if someone has caught your attention, feel free to make the first move and wave “Hello”.  No double-opt in is required before reaching out to another user.

### When I receive a “Hello” wave, how can I respond to it?

When someone waves “Hello”, it shows up in your “Notifications”. If you'd like to accept this “Hello”, you only need to tap on the notification and respond to the message. However, if you do not want to speak with that person, you can tap on the X button and they will be removed.

### What kind of notifications do I receive?

Each time you receive a “Hello”, a new message, or meetup invite, a push notification will alert you and you’ll never miss another opportunity.  All notifications are accessible on the “Notifications” page. By tapping on a notification, you can directly access someone’s profile or message.
How does the radar feature work?

Radar is a unique feature that allows you to find people who are located at the same venue/event as you are.  When you are in a specific location, just tap the radar to scan the venue and get a list of people who are also there and match your preferences.  You can then message them, and, if approved, meet up right away.  To use this feature, you must have Bluetooth enabled.

### What are “Featured Venues” on the heatmap?

These are locations that have sponsored events/meetups going on.  You can tap the venue to see a list of people who are currently there.  This can help you decide if you want to go check things out in person.

### What is “Meet Now”?

“Meet Now” offers a quick and safe way to meet up with someone.  You simply pick a venue, the date/time, and send your invite.  The other person has 4 hours to respond to the invitation.  Once confirmed, you can chat about any additional details.  All meetups are 30 minutes, but you can always stay longer.

### What happens after I meet up with someone?

After meeting up, you’ll be asked to rate your experience and decide if it was “Hot” or “Cold”.  The other person won’t be notified for 24 hours, so be honest.  If the answer is “Cold”, that person will be removed from your heatmap and you won’t have to interact again.  If the answer for both sides is “Hot”, one person will get a prompt to initiate further contact.  No more awkwardness about who should text first.

### How can I report someone?

At any time, you can click “Report User” on the person’s profile.  In order for us to better evaluate the situation and take the necessary measures, it’s important that you indicate the reason for the report and what the concern is about.
