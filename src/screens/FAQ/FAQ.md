# FAQs

### How can I find conversations using the heatmap?

Use the map to check out nearby people who are having real-time conversations. Move towards the hotspots and tap to see popular discussions and how many people are chatting in a given area/topic. You’ll see their profile icons and status topics right on the map.

### Does the heatmap indicate my exact position in real time?

No, your exact location is never revealed nor does the heatmap reveal the exact locations of other users.

### How do I interact with other people privately?

If you find someone you want to chat with, simply tap their profile icon and send them a message.

### How do I post a status topic?

Use the big icon located on the bottom menu. Once you've created a status topic, you can drop it on the map.

### How do I see the status topic that I posted?

To see your status topic, just tap the icon that says “statuses” located on the bottom menu. The status topic you posted will show up, along with other statuses you’ve been recently active with. You will also have access to your status topic via the map, if you dropped it.

### What kind of notifications will I receive?

Right now, only push notifications from direct messages are available. In the near future a push notification will alert you also when a relevant status topic is dropped on the map, this way you’ll never miss another opportunity. By tapping on a notification, you can directly access someone’s profile or message.

### Where are my messages located?

Tap the menu bar in the top left corner and you’ll see your inbox.

### Can I block someone?

We’re working on adding this option, but it is not available yet. There is zero tolerance for harassment of any kind, so if you experience a problem with another user, feel free to reach out and contact us directly. Please indicate the reason for your concern to allow us to take action (emails are listed in the Terms & Conditions section).

### What features are planned for future versions?

We have several exciting features in the works. Here’s a preview of what we’re doing to enhance your experience:

**Audio conversations**
You’ll be able to use an audio option to join conversations and listen to others speak.  You can always still use text if you’re not comfortable with audio.

**Meetups, featured Events, etc.**
Soon, you’ll be able to post meetups, events, or other gatherings on the heatmap. Additionally, we’ll have sponsored venues and events listed on the heatmap to keep you aware of things that are going on in your city. You can check out these spots to see who’s there and what’s happening to help you decide if you want to attend.

**Synced notifications**
Met someone you want to keep in touch with or explore a potential relationship?  You’ll be able to hit “Interested” on their profile and, if it’s mutual, you’ll be notified 24 hours later.

**Meet Now**
“Meet Now” offers a quick and safe way to meet up with someone. You simply pick a venue, the date/time, and send your invite. The other person has 4 hours to respond to the invitation. Once confirmed, you can chat about any additional details.

**Mutual approvals before messaging**
You can approve which users are allowed to message you. If you turn this feature on, a user will have to wave “Hello” first and wait for your approval before messaging you. Remember not to wait too long to respond if you’re interested in chatting because “Hello” waves expire within 4 hours.
