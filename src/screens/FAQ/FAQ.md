# FAQs

### How can I find someone using the heatmap?

Use the map to check out nearby people who have dropped statuses within the last 4 hours. Move towards the hotspots and tap to see how many people are in a given area. You’ll see their profile icons and status updates right on the map.

### Does the heatmap or radar indicate my exact position in real time?

No, your exact location is never revealed nor does the heatmap or radar reveal the exact locations of other users. The heatmap and radar only indicate your general vicinity and will not provide specific distances.

### How do I interact with other profiles?

If you find someone you’re interested in, simply tap their profile icon and send them a message.

### How does the “radar” feature work?

Radar is a unique feature that allows you to see real-time status updates from people who are nearby. When the radar is on, you'll be able to discover new people, as well as be discovered. Press the big button and anyone who is currently active will appear on the screen.

### How do I post a status?

Use the status icon located in the top right corner. Once you've created a status, you can either drop it on the map, or use it with the radar feature.

### How do I see the status that I posted?

To see your status, just tap the menu bar in the top left corner and then tap your profile picture. The status you posted will pop up. You will also have access to your status via the map, if you dropped it.

### What kind of notifications will I receive?

Each time you receive a new message, a push notification will alert you and you’ll never miss another opportunity. By tapping on a notification, you can directly access someone’s profile or message.

### Where are my messages located?

Tap the menu bar in the top left corner and you’ll see your inbox.

### Can I block someone?

We’re working on adding this option, but it is not available yet. There is zero tolerance for harassment of any kind, so if you experience a problem with another user, feel free to reach out and contact us directly. Please indicate the reason for your concern to allow us to take action (emails are listed in the Terms & Conditions section).

### What features are planned for future versions?

We have several exciting features in the works. Here’s a preview of what we’re doing to enhance your experience:


**Meetups, featured Events, etc.**
Soon, you’ll be able to post meetups, events, or other gatherings on the heatmap. Additionally, we’ll have sponsored venues and events listed on the heatmap to keep you aware of things that are going on in your city. You can check out these spots to see who’s there and what’s happening to help you decide if you want to attend.

**Synced notifications**
Met someone you want to keep in touch with or explore a potential relationship?  You’ll be able to hit “Interested” on their profile and, if it’s mutual, you’ll be notified 24 hours later.

**Meet Now**
“Meet Now” offers a quick and safe way to meet up with someone. You simply pick a venue, the date/time, and send your invite. The other person has 4 hours to respond to the invitation. Once confirmed, you can chat about any additional details.

**Mutual approvals before messaging**
You can approve which users are allowed to message you. If you turn this feature on, a user will have to wave “Hello” first and wait for your approval before messaging you. Remember not to wait too long to respond if you’re interested in chatting because “Hello” waves expire within 4 hours.
