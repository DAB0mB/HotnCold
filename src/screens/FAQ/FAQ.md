# FAQs

### How do the colors represent?

Hot&Cold makes a clever use of “hot” and “cold” colors to indicate information and activity on the map:

- High-energy conversations with many participants and messages are represented by clusters of red dots, indicating a discussion is “hot” while slower ones are displayed as “cold” with blue dots.
- Statuses which are intended to invite others to meet up will be “hot” with pink color, while statuses which were created to have an online discussion will be “cold” with light-blue color.

### Does the heatmap indicate my exact position in real time?

No, your exact location is never revealed nor does the heatmap reveal the exact locations of other users.

### How do I interact with other people privately?

If you find someone you want to chat with, simply tap their profile icon and send them a message.

### How do I post a status topic?

Use the big icon located on the bottom menu. Once you've created a status topic, you can drop it on the map.

### How do I see the status topic that I posted?

To see your status topic, just tap the icon that says “history” located on the bottom menu. The status topic you posted will show up, along with other statuses you’ve been recently active with. Alternatively, you can tap on your profile picture from the side menu and you should be able to see your posts feed.

### What kind of notifications will I receive?

You will receive push notifications from direct messages, and you can optionally subscribe to push notifications of group conversations by tapping the "subscribe" button from the drop down menu of the chat.

### Where are my messages located?

Tap the menu bar in the top left corner and you’ll see your inbox.

### Can I block someone?

We’re working on adding this option, but it is not available yet. There is zero tolerance for harassment of any kind, so if you experience a problem with another user, feel free to reach out and contact us directly. Please indicate the reason for your concern to allow us to take action (emails are listed in the Terms & Conditions section).
